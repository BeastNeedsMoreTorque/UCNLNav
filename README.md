# UCNLNav

## WARNING!

If this repository achieves:

25 start - we'll add partial implementation in MATLAB  
50 stars - we'll add AoA (Angle of arrival) estimation routines  
100 stars - we'll add C implementation of the library  
150 stars - we'll add complete documentation for the library  

This library contains routines for:
* Solving geodetic problems (Vincenty equations, haversine)
* Solving navigation & positioning problems (TOA & TDOA)

Basic example of usage is in UCNLNav_Tests demo application.

26-AUG-2019 Update:  
* Routines for VLBL (Virtual long baseline) positioning
* TDOA solution in 3D
