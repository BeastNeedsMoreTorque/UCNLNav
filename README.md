## Wow, guys, thanks for all the stars you gave! I am glad I made something which improves the world.

# UCNLNav

This library contains routines for:
- Solving geodetic problems (C#/Rust/Matlab)
- Solving TDOA & TOA positioning/navigation problems in 2D & 3D (C#/Rust/Matlab)
- Solving AOA (angle of arrival) navigation problem (C#/Rust/Matlab)
- Algorithms for Virtual Long Baseline positioning (C#)  

# Example of TDOA problem
- Known times of arrival to/from base points with known locations
- Known target depth

## WARNING!

If this repository achieves:

- DONE! 25 stars - we'll add partial implementation in MATLAB (Ok, I have uploaded Matlab version on 20 stars =)
- DONE! 50 stars - we'll add AoA (Angle of arrival) estimation routines (AOA estimation routines uploaded on 49 stars)  
- 100 stars - we'll add C implementation of the library  
- 150 stars - we'll add complete documentation for the library  

## HISTORY

19-AUG-2020 Update
* Some bugfixes and small improvements
* Added AOA (Angle of arrival) estimation routines, for more info, please, see Matlab demo script:

30-NOV-2019 Update:
* Added partial implementation of the library in Rust:
- All the functionality from Algorithms.cs & from Navigation.cs


22-NOV-2019 Update:  
* In GeoPoints.cs new classes for metric point (MPoint and MPoint3D)  
* In Navigation.cs new methods for calculating centroids of clouds of MPoint and MPoint3D, 
converting between local and geographic coordinate systems, methods for calculating statistics (CEP, SEP, STD, MRSE, DRMS)
